# ukelele-songs

## What this is

An app to collect the ukelele songs and chord progressions I like to play.

Here's the app in real life: https://ukelele-songs.netlify.app.

## Under the hood

Apart from being a useful app, it's also a way for me to learn new things.

I've built this app using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Twind](https://twind.dev) and [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).
